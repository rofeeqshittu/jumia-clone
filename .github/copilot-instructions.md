## Project Guidelines

This is a **Jumai clone** frontend project built with React and Vite. Follow these guidelines when generating code:

### Code Style Guidelines
- Write **clean, readable code** suitable for mid-level developers
- Use **simple and straightforward** patterns - no overly complex abstractions
- Keep components **small and focused** with single responsibility
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Add clear **comments** where necessary but avoid obvious comments
- Follow **consistent formatting** and indentation

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with JavaScript (not TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- **Git**: Simple, clear commit messages

### Project Structure
- Keep components in `src/components/`
- Use functional components with hooks
- Create reusable UI components
- Keep styling inline with Tailwind classes
- Store static assets in `public/`

### Best Practices
- Write code that **looks human-written**, not AI-generated
- Use **semantic HTML** elements
- Ensure **responsive design** with Tailwind utilities
- Keep **accessibility** in mind
- Write **self-documenting code**
- Avoid over-engineering solutions

### Git Commit Style
Use simple, clear commit messages:
- `add header component`
- `fix responsive layout`
- `update navigation styles`
- `add login form`
